# Superposition and Linearity
2.3, we were learning about superposition with electrostatics. One person asked in what case would we depart from superposition in a linear sense. Acc. to the wikipedia page,
'In most realistic physical situations, the equation governing the wave is only approximately linear. ..., For examples of phenomena that arise when the superposition principle does not exactly hold, see the articles nonlinear optics and nonlinear acoustics.'
