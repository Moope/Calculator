Gurren Lagann Review:


// Episode 3:
I (big pictures): 
Kamina and Simon are partners
- they succeed together
- simon understands kamina
- kamina understands simon
- Rather than manliness, it's the idea of moving forward, to rise over obstacles. Not just to rise above obstacles, but to stand above them, to have nothing over their heads, nothing casting a shadow. To live in the open.
- You > Dreams, is what GL is about. 

II (shown):
Simon understands kamina, how kamina wasn't really searching for his dad, or misses him, but how he regretted the opportunity to keep on going.

III (diaglogue):
Simon: "I'm scared, but I'm sure we can win tomorrow."
Kamina "That's the part I think will save my life one day."
.

IV (questions):
I'm not sure what Yoko stands for, or what role females play in this show.

Cyberpunk Brain Dump:
<ul>
  <li>Cyberpunk is set in a single city dominated by technology. There seems to be clear class distinctions, with a lower and upper class. All the people seem to be able to plug themselves into the city - with a usb c connection. Through these connections, it seems like users are able to experience different environments, experience other POVs, work and communicate. </li>
  <li>The story revolves around a boy named David Martinez. His mother - a paramedic? - and him live in the lower economic district, where she just barely makes enough to send David to an elite school. David is a stellar student and his mother dreams of him climbing the corporate ladder. </li>
  <li>It seems like a mark of success in the city is your corporate standing. </li>
