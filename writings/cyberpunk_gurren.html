    \section*{Personal Motivation}
    I just finished watching watching Cyberpunk a couple of days ago and as much as I'd love to jump onto the hypetrain and say that it's amazing, I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. The ending sure did hit though. It felt like your typical netflix show nowadays, day, filled with gore and sex, the world is a dog eat dog world and the once naive main character must join in all the carnage or perish. This is very much a generalization of netflix shows, but nevertheless, I want to understand Cyberpunk and love it in all it's g(l)ory. So here I am. While slowly unravelling the tale of Cyberpunk, another series appeared in the edge of my mind and I started to wonder, although the two are very different in tone, at core, I have an inkling Gurren Lagann shares a very similar tale and message.
    \subsection*{Disclaimer: }
    The motivation behind this essay isn't to claim that Cyberpunk is a copy of Gurren Lagann, or that one series is better than another, but to instead further enlighten ourselves through holding the two series side by side. By examining how different authors approach similar themes, I'm sure we can further appreciate both works.

Cyberpunk Brain Dump:
<ul>
  <li>Cyberpunk is set in a single city dominated by technology. There seems to be clear class distinctions, with a lower and upper class. All the people seem to be able to plug themselves into the city - with a usb c connection. Through these connections, it seems like users are able to experience different environments, experience other POVs, work and communicate. </li>
  <li>The story revolves around a boy named David Martinez. His mother - a paramedic? - and him live in the lower economic district, where she just barely makes enough to send David to an elite school. David is a stellar student and his mother dreams of him climbing the corporate ladder. </li>
  <li>It seems like a mark of success in the city is your corporate standing. </li>
