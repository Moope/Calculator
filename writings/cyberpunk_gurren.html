    \section*{Personal Motivation}
    I just finished watching watching Cyberpunk a couple of days ago and as much as I'd love to jump onto the hypetrain and say that it's amazing, I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. The ending sure did hit though. It felt like your typical netflix show nowadays, day, filled with gore and sex, the world is a dog eat dog world and the once naive main character must join in all the carnage or perish. This is very much a generalization of netflix shows, but nevertheless, I want to understand Cyberpunk and love it in all it's g(l)ory. So here I am. While slowly unravelling the tale of Cyberpunk, another series appeared in the edge of my mind and I started to wonder, although the two are very different in tone, at core, I have an inkling Gurren Lagann shares a very similar tale and message.
    \subsection*{Disclaimer: }
    The motivation behind this essay isn't to claim that Cyberpunk is a copy of Gurren Lagann, or that one series is better than another, but to instead further enlighten ourselves through holding the two series side by side. By examining how different authors approach similar themes, I'm sure we can further appreciate both works.

    episode 6 was almost useless
    - there was a point that I made though about how all the females are like "simon is unreliable, follows kamina." yoko was like "if simon tries harder he could be a good man." but kamina just talks loudly, has a loud voice. I wouldn't say that kamina is unreliable though, it's just that without simon he can't do anything, kamina has no 'power' (mecha as metric) kamina has spirit though. and simon without kamina doesn't move forward. simon has more 'power' but lacks in spirit. and does lacking spirit make one unreliable? maybe.


    episode 7
    First mention of the spiral king. Gunmen are operated by beastmen. To operate the gunmen, you need spirit, so do the beastmen have spirit? What differentiates beastmen from humans? besides the obvious. A fortess, better a mobile fortress than a stationary one? The beginning of this episode, we have kamina and simon fighting Viral. "The first time someone has cast such a large shadow over me" - Kamina. Simon again is like "we're no match!" Something else of note, Kamina is the only one ever talking to the gunmen. Everyone else talks to kamina and asks kamina to reconsider. 

    If "Kamina dies, who will lead us?" - Yoko
    Simon tries convinces Kamina to retreat. He tries the same thing, I'm scared ofc, 
    Kamina says no.
    Simon is the one who thinks of a plan. Kamina "I'll leave this to you[simon]" doesn't work.
    Kamina here doesn't hold onto the controls, and simon takes over.
    I should put together my thoughts before going on. to make my later analysis more meaningful.
    It's a trap, why does simon lick his lips here?
    I want to eat shin ramyun tomorrow, but mom will be home, so I guess not?
    It's Kamina who's remembered as a legend. the idiot who stole and gunman and started fighing with it. Which honestly, is an amazing feat, rather than simon who found a mecha right? Kamina, rather than being a chosen one, made himself a protagonist.

    Kamina: "we'll keep stealing until they stop cmoing after us." don't you want the kids to live in a world without fear? We're not the Gurren Brigade, we're the 'Dai-Gurren Brigade."
    Yoko: "Kamina dives in without thinking, truly reckless behavior. really outnumbered. Yoko was afraid."
    Kamina: doesn't say anything here.
    Everyone at this point is cheering on simon, the children are like "don't be scared you can do this!"
    Yoko is telling Kamina he can't do this, and to be scared.
    COMPARISON.
    Idea: let's look at the lyrics of the opening and ending of each series. 
    
    \section{The Argument}

    \section{On Cyberpunk}
Ok now that my short thoughts are out of the way, what I want to talk about today is on my thoughts about dreams, Cyberpunk, and Gurren Lagann, or really my lack of them (tomorrow's entry can be about the mysterous disappearence of thoughts for my tattoo essay). In these past weeks, I've been in love with the idea of interplay between dreams and reality. With Cyberpunk, we have a tale of David Martinez who is a resident of Night City. In the beginning of the story, we are brought to a time where David and his mother are working together in the system to change their life. Walking the hard straight life if you will (not so straight as revealed later). David has immense academic potential and is slugging through one of the top high schools of the city as an all-A student. His mother dreams of him graduating, and getting a job in corporate, and rising in rank through their ladders. It is through changes in David's professional position that his mother anticipates will change how the people around them perceive the Martinez family. A misguided belief? perhaps so, an expansion for a different paragraph. 

  <br><br>
  After Gloria's, David's mother's, death, David meets Lucy and gets introduced to Running. Through joining the Running gang, David in a way chooses to change his position not through academics, but through street smarts, through getting chromed, through raising his rank within this crew and the people of that underground Night City world. His new dream as well is to help Lucy get to the Moon. We find out later that getting to the Moon isn't as expensive as you'd think, so I am confused why the two of them didn't just go to the moon as soon as they acquried the necessary funds. Perhaps there were attachments, things Night City held captive and bound David, and by extension Lucy, to its domain. David himself never figures out what his dreams are, why the writers left David dreamless is up to anyone's guess, but the way I view it, David is a vessel. He's perhaps the Icarus of this tale, and in a way, a vessel not only for the dreams of others in this tale, but also the audience. Without a dream, David's left to helping others achieve theirs, first with Gloria, then with Lucy, or perhaps his own dream is to help others realize theirs. I doubt this, the vessel hypothesis is more likely. David is not only swung around willingly by Gloria, Lucy, old boss dude, but also Night City. Question, what's the dream of Night City? What does Night City stand for? 

  <br><br> 
  More on David being a vessel for the audience. We all like to imagine ourselves as the protagonist of our own tale. David is no exception. If David was born in a different time, in a different city, in a different <it>world</it>, he would no doubt have been successful. David is described to have exceptional academic abilities as well as cyberwear tolerance. He was originally an immensely kind and sympathetic soul (weren't we all?), shown by many drawn out scenes where he holds difficulty in taking the life of another - using a gun. And even after Night City has forced him to take the shot, it's after all, a dog eats dog world, he still upholds himself in the manner of the person who he most respected. He's gentle, honorable and honest to Lucy and his team. Perhaps in a leader's role, he also carries the hopes and aspirations of a better life for the people under him. The responsibliity is a lot, and the only way in David's mind to protect those he cares about is to get stronger. How does David get stronger? he takes in, and takes in more and more chrome. Perhaps symbollically chrome stands for the responsibilities and hits he can take from Night City, to delay the inevitable from his friends for longer. Later on, even when David is bombarded with messages from Rebecca and Lucy to take a step down from the Chrome, to not go into the Mecha, David continues. I think here we're presented with the illusion of choice. 

  <br><br> 
  The basic idea >> David has to keep moving forward, otherwise he and his friends will die. I think there's something to be said about deluding yourself in Night City or not that you have a choice to make. A future you decide. When was David's future set in stone? After meeting Lucy? After deciding to take charge of the Gang after the old boss' death? When David was born? The more I think about this, this show is less about dreams, than it is about portraying the helplessness of it all. Gurren Lagann couldn't be anymore different. And mayber there's an argument to be made there too.

ep 4
that was so messed up 
they joked about boota being emergency rations, but when boota himself offered to be emergency rations, that was a bit too much. 
I'm not really quite sure what the simon-kamina interactions here meant. 
in this episode, we were introduced to the dark something siblings. the three girls and one dude. it took a long time for kamina to accept simon's combination. kamina kept swatting simon away. I wonder what I can say about kamina, as kamina was in a position where he was being pressured to combine as well, as well as the one saying no to simon. Simon was confused as ever.
