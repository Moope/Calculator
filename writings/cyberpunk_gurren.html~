    \section*{Personal Motivation}
    I just finished watching watching Cyberpunk a couple of days ago and as much as I'd love to jump onto the hypetrain and say that it's amazing, I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. The ending sure did hit though. It felt like your typical netflix show nowadays, day, filled with gore and sex, the world is a dog eat dog world and the once naive main character must join in all the carnage or perish. This is very much a generalization of netflix shows, but nevertheless, I want to understand Cyberpunk and love it in all it's g(l)ory. So here I am. While slowly unravelling the tale of Cyberpunk, another series appeared in the edge of my mind and I started to wonder, although the two are very different in tone, at core, I have an inkling Gurren Lagann shares a very similar tale and message.
    \subsection*{Disclaimer: }
    The motivation behind this essay isn't to claim that Cyberpunk is a copy of Gurren Lagann, or that one series is better than another, but to instead further enlighten ourselves through holding the two series side by side. By examining how different authors approach similar themes, I'm sure we can further appreciate both works.

episode 3, 

kamina and simon as partners
we were shown that simon really understands kamina - how kamina wasn't really searching for his dad, or misses him, but how he regretted the opportunity to keep on going. 
themes, rather than manliness, it's the idea of keep moving forward. rising over obstacles. 
I'm not quite sure what yoko stands for. 
another moment is when simon was like "I'm scared, but I'm sure we can win tomorrow, and kamina was like "that's the part I think will save my life one day." 
Where are the dreams? GL is more about rising over obstacles, overcoming first yourself, others, and then the world (fate)? 
the more I think about it, CP couldn't be anymore different than GL. 
whereas CP is about never truly succeeding? 


ep 4
that was so messed up 
they joked about boota being emergency rations, but when boota himself offered to be emergency rations, that was a bit too much. 
I'm not really quite sure what the simon-kamina interactions here meant. 
in this episode, we were introduced to the dark something siblings. the three girls and one dude. it took a long time for kamina to accept simon's combination. kamina kept swatting simon away. I wonder what I can say about kamina, as kamina was in a position where he was being pressured to combine as well, as well as the one saying no to simon. Simon was confused as ever.

Cyberpunk Brain Dump:
<ul>
  <li>Cyberpunk is set in a single city dominated by technology. There seems to be clear class distinctions, with a lower and upper class. All the people seem to be able to plug themselves into the city - with a usb c connection. Through these connections, it seems like users are able to experience different environments, experience other POVs, work and communicate. </li>
  <li>The story revolves around a boy named David Martinez. His mother - a paramedic? - and him live in the lower economic district, where she just barely makes enough to send David to an elite school. David is a stellar student and his mother dreams of him climbing the corporate ladder. </li>
  <li>It seems like a mark of success in the city is your corporate standing. </li>
