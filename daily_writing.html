    It's difficult to express to others how sad you are when you aren't sad in the moment. Should we even be trying to express sadness? The answer ought to be yes, but it's difficult to express sadness to someone who is happy, and it's also hard to express sadness to another sorrow-filled soul. It's like I udnerstand your sadness, but how much really? The only solution is to really get to know the other person better - one or a couple of significant others who you spend time around with, and they see you in the good and bad times. I know I don't have anyone around me right now who's like that. Person W I think has ghosted me. Person A is on the other side of the world. And my sister is also not by me. When I'm in Taiwan, I'm going to go all out on my hobbies and finding people of similar interests - making friends.

    Last night, or really yesterday, I got annoyed at lunch - and later tried to bring it up. Skipping over details, I realized that I was misdirecting my annoyance to the person where part of the problem is with me. The issue is as such, I live in a world where no one lies, and so anytime I hear people consider that someone else has lied, I feel uncomfortable. I then try to mask this discomfort with data, science, and a plethora of other reasons - which are totally valid (imo). Having someone lie is one possibility out of so many more, and I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I myself came to the proposition that the other person may have lied. Maybe the world I live in is a little too naive, maybe it's better to have this faith in people, this is something I'll have to continue pondering on. I don't think it's in anyone's best interest to lie, and how can people do it? But I've certaintly caught myself many times saying little white lies, and omitting the truth, although I don't like to admit this. I wonder what people think about this subject - I think I'll read some books and articles on this and get back to this issue.

    I think an important skill of being a good researcher is knowing how to check yourself and when you can be sure you're right. More specifically, do your results make sense? Has something gone wrong in the code? Are you sure that your results are unbiased? Over the course of my work with Professor Berezovsky, that's certainly something I was really bad at, but I like to think I've gotten so much better! Now I actually think about the results that I've obtained and what they mean. Currently in my work with Prof. Chen, I can recognize that I'm doing this - actually thinking about the results I'm getting and what they mean.

    I say this to a lot of people, I don't like deep learning, but I want to be here when it gets better. I think a more accurate phrasing is, "I don't like deep learning, but I want to be the one to make it better." I think I really could work on this problem while doing deep learning for medical imaging - the question is, am I capable enough? Even if I have a idea, do I need to be handheld to get it completed? If I'm not capable enough, can I get better? Last night at the Physics Birthday Bash (CWRU) I heard that Corbin's motto for mentoring and his work is "Do it a little less wrong next time." I would like to adopt that thinking. Maybe "Be a little bit more capable next time." I think for sure what allowed me to at least have a running start with the Wang project was my previous failures with Julia. What allowed me to also have a better start with Yong is my struggles on loss functions and inefficiencies with keeping track of runs with the Wang project. (Not to mention how much I've improved since my research years with Jesse.) From here on out, I'll try to keep in mind that I have gotten better, and I'll become a little bit more capable each time.

    The next writing entry will be on scientific creativity and impact wrt age.
