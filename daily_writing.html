      Today I went to see El Nino by the Cleveland Orchestra. I'm glad I attended. The whole performance itself was a journey, aside from my material hinderances (I dowsed off a couple of times and my stomach became incresingly problematic), I was in large in amazement and the ending was so beautiful.

    <h2>2022.nov.16</h2>
    I wonder if I know myself a lot less than I thought, and that results in me making statements that don't always hold up. Is this something I need to feel so horrible about? How do other people go about their lives? Surely I'm not in the minority where I say statements about myself that only hold true in certain situations? Anyways, where I really wanted to go with this entry is about music, more specifically classical music. Tonight I watched a concert, a student concert. There's a lot to cover. In rough, I'm going to (un)cover my thoughts on 1) listening to classical music, 2) orchestral music and student groups, and 3) performing and creating music. <br>
    <h3>Listening to Classical Music</h3>
    My roommate actually stated earlier in the day that apparently I said I hate classical music. I wouldn't put it past me to say something along those lines, or be confusing enough for her to think that, but hate is certainly not true. I dislike using classical music as study music, because of 1) a weird mix of respect and belief that the music is so complex that to truly enjoy it, I need to completely pay attention to it. I think the best way to explain this is like food. I think the best way to enjoy food is to silently eat without anything going on in the background. But in the case of music, I am preventing myself from listening to classical music because I can't commit the time and effort it takes to stop everything else I'm doing and just listen to the music. and 2) music that goes on for too long in the background turns into white noise, and classical music is especially susceptible to that, since it's so so complex. I say this while listening to classical music in the background. The hypocripsy. But maybe I need to extend the analogy to food even more. Just because I can't always be in a situation where I can eat food without any distractions and in peace, I should loosen up my requirements to listen to classical music. Afterall, there's so much classical music out there, and although the impact of the piece is dampened because I'm exploring what's out there in the background, nonetheless, I'm listening and discovering pieces I know I'll enjoy even more when I solely pay attention to it. With regards to my roommate, she reasoned that because I dislike Vivaldi and am extremely resistent to going to Severence Hall, I must dislike listening to classical music, at least to some extent - and I understand where she comes from. I have an inkling why but I mostly have no idea why, that even the thought of listening to Vivalidi genuinely fills me with rage. As for Severence Hall, I reasoned that I hate going out. But I go out all the time? I even went out tonight to see a student concert - more on that later. And I know what really determines whether or not I go out is my emotional attachment. The bottom line is, if there's people I wish to see, people who I want to support or media pieces which I feel deeply about, I will go, and think that makes me normal. I think what is especially difficult with classical music, art, and movies and shows, is remembering that these are all genres in their own right. There's so much variety in classical music, and I am guilty of forgetting that I can enjoy certain pieces in classical music, certain artists, and not feel so deeply about the other stuff.
    <br>
    <h3>Orchestral Music and Student Groups</h3>
    As to why student groups is its own topic, orchestral music is the subgenre of classical music that I would prefer not to listen to - unless again, I have some personal connection to it. There are a couple reasons for this. The first would be the scale of orchestral music, orchestras can have up to 100 musicians, while chamber orchestras and groups can have anywhere from 3 to 24 performers. As I was listening to tonight's concert, I remembered why I prefer chamber music and solo performance so so much more, and it's because in smaller group ensembles, you can hear the performer. You can hear the performer's personality, character, and vision for the piece. This is why I also immensely enjoy chamber orchestras - essentially mini orchestras for those who are unfamiliar. In orchestral music, you hear the composer, you hear their ego, and you hear their vision. This can be a wonderful thing, and it was It was a fantastic suprise for tonight's performers to really evoke that character in Liszt's Les Preludes. But I'd argue that you more often then not, lose an important sense of intimacy. The sense of grandious landscapes, fate, battles and all these greater things can become tiring and what I really love are the smaller things. Wistful love ballads, lullabies, chants, folk tunes, the here and now are what really touches me. The amount of which a piece can emotionally appeal to me can also be a result of having performed the piece before. More often than not, this outlier case applies to orchestral pieces. Whenever I listen to pieces I have previously performed, I recall the rehearsals and precise sections of the piece, the ups and downs that me and the other performers had during this time. Most concisely, my thoughts are "Oh I remeber this section," and whether or not it was a particularly melodic line, or technically challenging one, I all back on all of them fondly. Furthermore, I actually most vividly recall the moments during the concert where I'm intensely aware and basking in the sense that I'm making something larger than myself. I don't think I'm describing in justice my listening experience, but I do get very emotional. I think that's why I find it so difficult to listen to student/amateur groups. Immersion is important to me, precisely because I'm thinking of all these things, but immersion is a fragile thing. While I don't have the most precise ear, I can pick up very easily (unintentinionally) out of tune performers, out of sync, time slip ups, shaky techniques, on an on. I dislike hearing the technical difficulties, and I do think this criticallity ruins my experience more than it has to. But I'm not quite sure how to remedy this.

    <h3>On Performing and Creating Music</h3>
    I played violin and viola for a number of years before college and as with any activity that you do for many years, there's a large stock of memories, stories, and feelings that come with it. I do feel immesely proud of where I achieved with the violin and viola and the performance activities I've done. Going into college, I had anticipated continuing to perform; however, reality hit and it became increasingly difficult to practice with my course load, research, and other extracurriculars. That wasn't the only reason though, on why I stopped. The other reason was that I disliked the ensembles here. My high school orchestra certaintly did not have a very high skill bar, but we had such camaraderie, and our orchestra director is one of the most amazing people I know. My local orchestra group has deep ties with the National Symphony Orchestra and is one of the best orchestra training programs in the nation, so the skill level was through the roof. So coming to my college's orchestra group, not enjoying the repertoire, not likeing the director, being unfamiliar with the people in the orchestra, my experience was at a bad middle ground. I tried out the chamber music program here as well (small group ensembles course) and again, my previous experience vastly outshone my current one. I would say one of the most important aspects of creating music to me is to feel connected to other people and build towards something larger than myself, and when I saw I couldn't achieve that here, I left my instruments at home, and dedicated myself to my studies. To others, I say that I'm satisfied with where I got, and although bittersweet, I'm alright with closing that chapter and starting a new one. I still think this is true, but I think somewhere in my future needs to involve performing or creating music. For these past four years, whenever I have heard any piece that I remotely enjoy, I always think that I should be creating music. And to some extent, I do think I've been beating myself too hard, we (college students) hardly even have time to read books. But I love music, and it's important to me, so Let it be known now that the end of my undergraduate studies is next installment of my life, and in this new season, I'll be creating music, writing essays like this, and living my life more outside of my studies.

    What am I left with after this reflection? Classical music close to my heart and I will make the time to be more active in listening to, performing and creating clasical music. This was a good reflection session.

    I can be really lazy when even when I do work, and it's been really productive recognizing when I do so - to then force myself to think. But enough about productivity comments. Today is the first day of November - which has no real significance to me other than knowing that I have a bit more than six weeks left at college. Many things still need to be done - and they will.

    I've doubly known for a long time that I dislike subjects typically for the reason of not knowing much about it, and I've more recently discovered that I have this wonderful ability to think and that often I just refuse to. Nuclear physics is the field where I've been saying that I have aboslutely no interest in, and I think it's primarily because there's so many different terms I have to know. But after learning and working with CT, and learning about photon attenuation, I really like it, and that indeed falls within nuclear physics. What is jarring is that visible light, xrays, and gamma rays are all the same thing, but called different things because of the time period it was discovered. I think if I just sit and read about the history of nuclear physics I'll like it so much more.

    Scientific communication doesn't happen through newspapers or journals, it takes place over social media. Maybe I can be a science vtuber. I should at least start with getting really good at writing and reading a ton more. I don't think an internship is where I'm going to acquire those skills, although they are a nice resume booster, but I think it's stuff like the math children's book idea and other creative projects that'll help to reach a broader audience and build my own platform.

    <h2>2022.oct.26</h2>
    It's difficult to express to others how sad you are when you aren't sad in the moment. Should we even be trying to express sadness? The answer ought to be yes, but it's difficult to express sadness to someone who is happy, and it's also hard to express sadness to another sorrow-filled soul. It's like I udnerstand your sadness, but how much really? The only solution is to really get to know the other person better - one or a couple of significant others who you spend time around with, and they see you in the good and bad times. I know I don't have anyone around me right now who's like that. Person W I think has ghosted me. Person A is on the other side of the world. And my sister is also not by me. When I'm in Taiwan, I'm going to go all out on my hobbies and finding people of similar interests - making friends.

    <h2>2022.oct.25</h2>
    Last night, or really yesterday, I got annoyed at lunch - and later tried to bring it up. Skipping over details, I realized that I was misdirecting my annoyance to the person where part of the problem is with me. The issue is as such, I live in a world where no one lies, and so anytime I hear people consider that someone else has lied, I feel uncomfortable. I then try to mask this discomfort with data, science, and a plethora of other reasons - which are totally valid (imo). Having someone lie is one possibility out of so many more, and I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I myself came to the proposition that the other person may have lied. Maybe the world I live in is a little too naive, maybe it's better to have this faith in people, this is something I'll have to continue pondering on. I don't think it's in anyone's best interest to lie, and how can people do it? But I've certaintly caught myself many times saying little white lies, and omitting the truth, although I don't like to admit this. I wonder what people think about this subject - I think I'll read some books and articles on this and get back to this issue.

    I think an important skill of being a good researcher is knowing how to check yourself and when you can be sure you're right. More specifically, do your results make sense? Has something gone wrong in the code? Are you sure that your results are unbiased? Over the course of my work with Professor Berezovsky, that's certainly something I was really bad at, but I like to think I've gotten so much better! Now I actually think about the results that I've obtained and what they mean. Currently in my work with Prof. Chen, I can recognize that I'm doing this - actually thinking about the results I'm getting and what they mean.

    I say this to a lot of people, I don't like deep learning, but I want to be here when it gets better. I think a more accurate phrasing is, "I don't like deep learning, but I want to be the one to make it better." I think I really could work on this problem while doing deep learning for medical imaging - the question is, am I capable enough? Even if I have a idea, do I need to be handheld to get it completed? If I'm not capable enough, can I get better? Last night at the Physics Birthday Bash (CWRU) I heard that Corbin's motto for mentoring and his work is "Do it a little less wrong next time." I would like to adopt that thinking. Maybe "Be a little bit more capable next time." I think for sure what allowed me to at least have a running start with the Wang project was my previous failures with Julia. What allowed me to also have a better start with Yong is my struggles on loss functions and inefficiencies with keeping track of runs with the Wang project. (Not to mention how much I've improved since my research years with Jesse.) From here on out, I'll try to keep in mind that I have gotten better, and I'll become a little bit more capable each time.

    The next writing entry will be on scientific creativity and impact wrt age.
