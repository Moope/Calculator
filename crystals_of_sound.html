  <h1>
    The Crystals of Sound
  </h1>
  <div id="Desc">
    For so many years, we've been entranced in understanding music through music theory - what sounds best and why can be attributed to chords, consonant intervals, cool chord progressions, and the vague awareness that all this is rooted in math, fractions, physics, and vibrations. This project presents to you a novel way of thinking about music in physics. Instead of finding the physics in music, we're proud to present how we found the music in physics.
