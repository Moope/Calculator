<h3> dedicated to my t1-84, and family ofc </h3>

<p> I want to make the following acknowledgement to my calculator. Thank you so much for your hard work for me through all these years. Every since the beginning of HS freshman year (I think), you've always been there for me. Even though you physically should not have been able to run, the times your battery has drained, you really gave it your all and sacrificed your last bit of life juice to help me get through that one math test in Mr. Sharp's class. I'll never forget you. Albeit you're still working even to now, 2020. It's time for me to move on, to my future without spamming parentheses and fiddling with absurdly large exponentials. Thanks to my family too, for having to listen to me rage, dealing with my off days, and still sticking around, always supporting and smiling. Except you Jin lmao, (jkjk). </p>
