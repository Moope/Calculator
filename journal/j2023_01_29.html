Yesterday was a long day. I ran, I got frustrated at Aunt again, I went out with my cousin and her husband from like 5pm to 2am. Found out that my Chinese 真的不行. Watched an okay movie. I don't know. The guy who sat next to me at dinner, lmao I kept thinking that if he was way younger, I would totally be into him. There was this elderly guy who kept calling me out for not understanding Chinese. I want to get on that Taiwan Dating App, to 1. make friends, and 2. talk more Chinese, and 3. get a boyfriend. Maybe the whole dating thing would be easier if I don't feel any romantic attraction. I think I've really only felt so far sexual attraction, and platonic love.
