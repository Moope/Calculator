<h2>2022.dec.7</h2>
  Two more days until the end of classes... 11 more days until everything should be done. I want to get out of here, this place makes me so uncomfortable. The people here make me so uncomfortable. It makes me upset, stressed, and exhausted how everywhere I go, I just hope not to see certain people - it's like I'm constantly playing a stealth game. Aside from that, my outfit today slays. I'm wearing my black-gold combat boots with my dark blue straight jeans for the bottom. I really enjoy my fringes, so I have my hair up in a ponytail with my fringes out, my super nice cottonball like white sweater, and lacy black choker. Clothing and fits are one of the few things that I'm able to look forward to/feel good about this semester. One other thing in that 'happiness' group is having coffee and oatmeal every morning. I'll take a picture later today. The subject of today's entry is going to be tattoos.
  <br><br>
  There are two things I want to do in Taiwan - or at least the two things I find myself thinking the most about. They are, 1) dying my hair pink, and 2) getting a tattoo. Point number 1) is a topic for another day and today is just going to be about getting a tattoo. I'm not sure how long I've wanted to get a tat and as far as I remember, I was always fascinated with the idea of putting art on my skin. Truthfully I didn't expect my parents - at the very least my dad, to be against tattoos, so I was surprised to hear that my dad flat out said no. I still think it's better that I let them know beforehand that I still intend on doing this before doing the deed, rather than telling them afterwards, but now I have to figure out a way to deal with this unexpected opposition. And I think my strategy moving forward will be to 1) repeatedly bring it up, and 2) write a monograph on tattoos. (Q: Why monograph instead of an essay? A: Monographs sound cooler).
  <br><br>
  I already have problems with myself and my dad in arguments, and I know that if I try to appeal to him, our discussion will escalate. It's better to present everything at once. At the same time, I myself would be upset if someone who I disagreed with sent me an essay, links and other sources on a POV I wholly disagree with. It makes the argument so much less impactful, and the other party much less receptive. To deal with this, I think I'll forego the typical essay structure in favor of a FAQ with additional structure kind of style. (I won't be able to finish this monograph today and I think I'll take this work as an exercise on arguing, debating, and writing). For today, let's aim for an outline.
  <br><br>
  The actually essay will contain a little too many personal details for me to comfortably post on the internet, but I think it would be of value to discuss my own views on tattoos and why I'm interested in getting them.
