<h2>2022.oct.26</h2>
It's difficult to express to others how sad you are when you aren't sad in the moment. Should we even be trying to express sadness? The answer ought to be yes, but it's difficult to express sadness to someone who is happy, and it's also hard to express sadness to another sorrow-filled soul. It's like I udnerstand your sadness, but how much really? The only solution is to really get to know the other person better - one or a couple of significant others who you spend time around with, and they see you in the good and bad times. I know I don't have anyone around me right now who's like that. Person W I think has ghosted me. Person A is on the other side of the world. And my sister is also not by me. When I'm in Taiwan, I'm going to go all out on my hobbies and finding people of similar interests - making friends.
