<h2>2022.oct.25</h2>
Last night, or really yesterday, I got annoyed at lunch - and later tried to bring it up. Skipping over details, I realized that I was misdirecting my annoyance to the person where part of the problem is with me. The issue is as such, I live in a world where no one lies, and so anytime I hear people consider that someone else has lied, I feel uncomfortable. I then try to mask this discomfort with data, science, and a plethora of other reasons - which are totally valid (imo). Having someone lie is one possibility out of so many more, and I don't think I've ever been in a situation where I myself came to the proposition that the other person may have lied. Maybe the world I live in is a little too naive, maybe it's better to have this faith in people, this is something I'll have to continue pondering on. I don't think it's in anyone's best interest to lie, and how can people do it? But I've certaintly caught myself many times saying little white lies, and omitting the truth, although I don't like to admit this. I wonder what people think about this subject - I think I'll read some books and articles on this and get back to this issue.
