<h2>2022.oct.27</h2>
Scientific communication doesn't happen through newspapers or journals, it takes place over social media. Maybe I can be a science vtuber. I should at least start with getting really good at writing and reading a ton more. I don't think an internship is where I'm going to acquire those skills, although they are a nice resume booster, but I think it's stuff like the math children's book idea and other creative projects that'll help to reach a broader audience and build my own platform.
