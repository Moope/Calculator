<h2>2022.nov.1</h2>
I can be really lazy when even when I do work, and it's been really productive recognizing when I do so - to then force myself to think. But enough about productivity comments. Today is the first day of November - which has no real significance to me other than knowing that I have a bit more than six weeks left at college. Many things still need to be done - and they will.
