I think an important skill of being a good researcher is knowing how to check yourself and when you can be sure you're right. More specifically, do your results make sense? Has something gone wrong in the code? Are you sure that your results are unbiased? Over the course of my work with Professor Berezovsky, that's certainly something I was really bad at, but I like to think I've gotten so much better! Now I actually think about the results that I've obtained and what they mean. Currently in my work with Prof. Chen, I can recognize that I'm doing this - actually thinking about the results I'm getting and what they mean.
