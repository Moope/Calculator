<h2>2023.jan.7</h2>
  Happy new year! Although a belated statement, the underlying emotion still holds. I'm excited for this new year, and optimisitic towards what 2023 has in store, or what I'll be able to accomplish this year. Some short comments before I get to the meat of this entry, 
  <li>
    <ul>Typically graduate school interviews for PhDs involve interviews with three different professors. For the Mayo Biomedical Engineering PhD program interview, they call for six back to back interviews with six different professors, each 30 minutes long. I'm glad that there will be lots of chances to promote myself, and six people will surely give a more accurately portrayl of who I am, but that's <it>six</it> 30 minute interview sessions all in one day over zoom. I'm not only definitely need to prepare for these interviews, but I also want to think of plan of how I'll relax afterwards</ul>
    <ul>I've been overcome with how much of a <it>drained sunset</it> mood I've been in the past week. In part caused by my sickness, in part caused by my loneliness, and lastly I suspect comes in part because of what I've been working on this past week. Or really, what I've <it>not</it> been working on. Here's an idea, baroque electronic music. I need to hold onto pursuing my passions, what I love, in order to not lose myself in this fast paced world of my 20s. Today I worked a lot on research, and that felt good. Perhaps I need to shift emphasis to projects that'll make me feel good when its done. But reasearch does that! There are so few hours in the day, and I can only dedicate so many hours  in the day towards work. I'd like this to be my game plan: Morning - Health and work work; Early afternoon - work work; Late afternoon - fun work; Evenings - languages, art, reading, and gaming. Surely this plan is foolproof?</ul>
    <ul>I don't think art can be my thing.</ul>
    <ul>Here's an idea, instead of having a list of projects, how about I make an estimate of how long a project will take? Then work on that project with that timeframe in mind. Having deadlines always help</ul>
  </li>

  Ok now that my short thoughts are out of the way, what I want to talk about today is on my thoughts about dreams, Cyberpunk, and Gurren Lagann, or really my lack of them (tomorrow's entry can be about the mysterous disappearence of thoughts for my tattoo essay). In these past weeks, I've been in love with the idea of interplay between dreams and reality. With Cyberpunk, we have a tale of David Martinez who is a resident of Night City. In the beginning of the story, we are brought to a time where David and his mother are working together in the system to change their life. Walking the hard straight life if you will (not so straight as revealed later). David has immense academic potential and is slugging through one of the top high schools of the city as an all-A student. His mother dreams of him graduating, and getting a job in corporate, and rising in rank through their ladders. It is through changes in David's professional position that his mother anticipates will change how the people around them perceive the Martinez family. A misguided belief? perhaps so, an expansion for a different paragraph. 

  <br><br>
  After Gloria's, David's mother's, death, David meets Lucy and gets introduced to Running. Through joining the Running gang, David in a way chooses to change his position not through academics, but through street smarts, through getting chromed, through raising his rank within this crew and the people of that underground Night City world. His new dream as well is to help Lucy get to the Moon. We find out later that getting to the Moon isn't as expensive as you'd think, so I am confused why the two of them didn't just go to the moon as soon as they acquried the necessary funds. Perhaps there were attachments, things Night City held captive and bound David, and by extension Lucy, to its domain. David himself never figures out what his dreams are, why the writers left David dreamless is up to anyone's guess, but the way I view it, David is a vessel. He's perhaps the Icarus of this tale, and in a way, a vessel not only for the dreams of others in this tale, but also the audience. Without a dream, David's left to helping others achieve theirs, first with Gloria, then with Lucy, or perhaps his own dream is to help others realize theirs. I doubt this, the vessel hypothesis is more likely. David is not only swung around willingly by Gloria, Lucy, old boss dude, but also Night City. Question, what's the dream of Night City? What does Night City stand for? 

  <br><br> 
  More on David being a vessel for the audience. We all like to imagine ourselves as the protagonist of our own tale. David is no exception. If David was born in a different time, in a different city, in a different <it>world</it>, he would no doubt have been successful. David is described to have exceptional academic abilities as well as cyberwear tolerance. He was originally an immensely kind and sympathetic soul (weren't we all?), shown by many drawn out scenes where he holds difficulty in taking the life of another - using a gun. And even after Night City has forced him to take the shot, it's after all, a dog eats dog world, he still upholds himself in the manner of the person who he most respected. He's gentle, honorable and honest to Lucy and his team. Perhaps in a leader's role, he also carries the hopes and aspirations of a better life for the people under him. The responsibliity is a lot, and the only way in David's mind to protect those he cares about is to get stronger. How does David get stronger? he takes in, and takes in more and more chrome. Perhaps symbollically chrome stands for the responsibilities and hits he can take from Night City, to delay the inevitable from his friends for longer. Later on, even when David is bombarded with messages from Rebecca and Lucy to take a step down from the Chrome, to not go into the Mecha, David continues. I think here we're presented with the illusion of choice. 

  <br><br> 
  The basic idea >> David has to keep moving forward, otherwise he and his friends will die. I think there's something to be said about deluding yourself in Night City or not that you have a choice to make. A future you decide. When was David's future set in stone? After meeting Lucy? After deciding to take charge of the Gang after the old boss' death? When David was born? The more I think about this, this show is less about dreams, than it is about portraying the helplessness of it all. Gurren Lagann couldn't be anymore different. And mayber there's an argument to be made there too.
