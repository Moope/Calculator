<h2>2022.oct.31</h2>
I've doubly known for a long time that I dislike subjects typically for the reason of not knowing much about it, and I've more recently discovered that I have this wonderful ability to think and that often I just refuse to. Nuclear physics is the field where I've been saying that I have aboslutely no interest in, and I think it's primarily because there's so many different terms I have to know. But after learning and working with CT, and learning about photon attenuation, I really like it, and that indeed falls within nuclear physics. What is jarring is that visible light, xrays, and gamma rays are all the same thing, but called different things because of the time period it was discovered. I think if I just sit and read about the history of nuclear physics I'll like it so much more.
