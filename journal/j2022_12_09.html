<h2>2022.dec.9</h2>
Today is the last day of courses. During lunch, we had a math department end of the semester celebration, and for dinner, we'll be having a physics party. Mixed feelings on the people who I've met over my time here, and what I left with. I can feel like shit but I would still be able to frce myself to sing along to songs. I should make a play list of songs I can completely sing. I hung out with three different friend groups and I just feel like shit. I just want fade away and spawn somewhere else.

I want to shift these entries from myself, to the world around me. I'll start doing this tomorrow.
